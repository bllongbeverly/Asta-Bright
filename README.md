## Description
I am using starter code for a portfolio that I am building for my future coding resume.  It will showcase my skills and talent for future employers to have access to and be able to review. It will highlight my strengths and weaknesses.

## Usage
This is to help starting coder's learn and adapt their knowledge in creating code through index.html and style.css.
